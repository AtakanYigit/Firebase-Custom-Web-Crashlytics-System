# Firebase-Custom-Web-Crashlytics-System
This is the Github repository for my article on Medium named "Firebase Crashlytics for Web (React.js)"
You can read it here ---> [Article Link]

## What Does This Do?
This repo demonstrates how a custom Firebase Web Crashlytics system works. Since Firebase Crashlytics only supports Android, Apple, Flutter and Unity apps and not web apps, I felt the need to implement it myself and share it with you all. It is for everyone's use, I hope you all enjoy it and find it useful. If you think the system can be improved, feel free to contact me.

## How to install?
```
git clone https://github.com/AtakanYigit/Firebase-Custom-Web-Crashlytics-System.git
cd Firebase-Custom-Web-Crashlytics-System
npm i
npm run dev
```
